# Basic types

In Kotlin, each variable and data structure has a type.

Kotlin's ability to "infer" the type is called "type inference".

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var customers = 10

    customers = 8 // Some customers leave the queue

    customers = customers + 3 // Example of addition: 11
    customers += 7            // Example of addition: 18
    customers -= 3            // Example of subtraction: 15
    customers *= 2            // Example of multiplication: 30
    customers /= 3            // Example of division: 10

    println(customers) // 10
}
```

In this Kotlin code:

`customers` is assigned an integer value by "type inference".
