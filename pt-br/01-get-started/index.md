# Get started with Kotlin 

Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language designed to make developers happier. It's concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.

To learn Kotlin in our classes, you may use [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/).

Here, we create a simple example of Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello, world!")
}
```
